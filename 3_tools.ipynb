    "LangChain offers various agent types, each suited for specific use cases. Here are some of the available agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-shot ReAct: This agent uses the ReAct framework to choose tools based solely on their descriptions. It requires descriptions for each tool and is highly versatile.\n",
    "- Structured input ReAct: This agent handles multi-input tools and is suitable for complex tasks like navigating a web browser. It uses a tools' argument schema for structured input.\n",
    "- OpenAI Functions: Specifically designed for models fine-tuned for function calling, this agent is compatible with models like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613. We used this to create our first agent above.\n",
    "- Conversational: Designed for conversational settings, this agent uses ReAct for tool selection and utilizes memory to remember previous interactions.\n",
    "- Self-ask with search: This agent relies on a single tool, \"Intermediate Answer,\" which looks up factual answers to questions. It's equivalent to the original self-ask with search paper.\n",
    "- ReAct document store: This agent interacts with a document store using the ReAct framework. It requires \"Search\" and \"Lookup\" tools and is similar to the original ReAct paper's Wikipedia example.\n",
